# Cuba + Ohm + OmniAuth + Octokit = GitHub Issues

Proof of concept of using Cuba + Ohm + OminAuth + OctoKit to access
GitHub issues for projects.

To use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth2 Application ID and
Secret on the [GitHub Applications Page](https://github.com/account/applications).

## TODO

* Improve design!
* Query GitHub API directly from JavaScript. Cache GitHub API queries
  results by using HTML5 `sessionStorage`
* Implement Backbone.js for views management
* Add tests
* ...etc...
